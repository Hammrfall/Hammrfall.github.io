            <p>I am a seasoned programmer with a B.A. from Samford University, who has also taken advantage of further adult
                education in programming, database design, and full stack web development. </p>
            <p> My work programming robotic systems controls gave me extensive experience in building proof of concept systems,
                connecting into customer databases, building flexible user interfaces, and generating reports and providing
                real-time data from the system .</p>

            <p>I am currently a part-time student at UCF and freelance web developer, interested in full-time work in the web
                development field.</p>

            <p>I am focused on providing elegant solutions by writing object based programs that provide maximum flexibility
                and code reusability, that also present intuitive interfaces for the user experience. I have lead teams of
                programmers to push projects forward in design, development, debugging, and implementation.</p>
                
            <p>I enjoy the collaborative nature of well executed projects, and I am always looking for “+1” opportunities to
                exceed expectations.</p>
