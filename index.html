            <p>
                I was born in Wisconsin, raised in Alabama, lived in Georgia, and currently reside in Florida.
                I enjoy writing, coding, and playing board games. I have a great family
                that is super-supportive, and lots of fun to be around.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe that communication of any kind should be clear, interesting, and compelling.
                Anything less is laziness on the part of the communicator.  Everything can be 
                conveyed in an exciting way with enough imagination and passion.
